Current Cost Cow is a PyGTK app to display realtime data from a Current Cost Meter

Meter Reading does exactly the same thing only is a text console app.

Both do the following:

Reads meter data from a Current Cost meter
Removes the history data because it's basically useless
Updates a mysql database
Changes the color of an Ambient Orb to reflect how much electricity we be using
